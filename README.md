Auxiliary tools and scripts for mmbTools
========================================

This folder contains a weakly structured collection of scripts and tools.

If you start with the mmbTools, don't look here. Have a look a the guide, the
wiki and the opendigitalradio website first. Many things here are old and broken.

Additional information might be found in README-SFN, that was written mid-2012.

There is:
 * a few .ini files: example configuration files for ODR-DabMod
 * test.config for ODR-DabMux
 * scripts to encode to mp2 and DAB+
 * moduhd\*.sh illustrate how to start dabmod before configuration files were created
 * mux-throttled.sh same for dabmux
 * qrg.txt list of channels/frequencies
 * eti\_tcp.py used to send ETI over TCP to dabmod
 * eti-udp/ experimental UDP transport with FEC, hasn't been pursued.
 * some ZMQ experiments
