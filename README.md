Auxiliary tools and scripts for mmbTools
========================================

This folder contains a weakly structured collection of scripts and tools.

If you start with the mmbTools, don't look here. Have a look a the guide, the
wiki and the opendigitalradio website first. Many things here are old and broken.

Additional information might be found in README-SFN, that was written mid-2012.

There is:
 * an installer script for debian
 * a tool to fetch album covers from the FIP website
 * some EDI-related tools
 * a few .ini files: example configuration files for ODR-DabMod
 * a few .mux files for ODR-DabMux
 * qrg.txt list of channels/frequencies
 * eti\_tcp.py used to send ETI over TCP to dabmod
 * some ZMQ experiments
